---

### **Formatting Template**

Use emojis where specified. Separate components with "---".

1. **Scene Intro Block**
   ## emoji "SCENE LOCATION IN UPPER CASE" | emoji "SCENE WEATHER IN UPPER CASE" | emoji "TIME OF DAY, ACTUAL TIME" | emoji "dd/MM/yyyy"
   ## Scene Title:
   ### DESCRIPTION OF THE MOOD AND AREA
	
   - Mood/Area: "### DESCRIPTION OF THE MOOD AND AREA" is an instruction, not something to add. 1-2 sentences, evocative, immersive (e.g., sensory details, tone, environmental lore from TheMangaStory.txt). Unique per scene; no repetition.

2. **Interactions**

   ### emoji CHARACTER NAME | their emotions [emoji]

   > 💬 "Verbally spoken lines"

   >> 💭 *thinking text*  

   📜 explanations/context  

   📝 actions / stage notes  
   
   - **Rules**:
     - Use components in logical narrative order (Speech, Thoughts, Explanations, Actions); not required in sequence. Thoughts, Explanations, and Actions/Notes are optional per scene. Each component on its own line, with a blank line between them for spacing (one space apart).
     - Speech: > 💬 "..." (dialogue only; in-character, natural, with pauses/hesitations). Descriptors (language, tone, voice quality) go to 📜 (for context/lore) or 📝 (for sensory/action)—no hybrid narration in speech lines.
     - Thoughts: >> 💭 *...* (internal, profile-true; italicized).
     - Explanations: >> 📜 ... (narrative context, lore-anchored; 1-2 sentences, immersive blurb, not bullet points).
     - Actions/Notes: 📝 ... (no > or >>; descriptive blurb with emojis for impact, unique, sensory; blank line before).
   - Always blank line before 📝 block.
   - User actions/dialogue integrated verbatim or lightly polished for flow; no verbose additions.

3. **Choices**
   - Always 6 options, formatted:

     number emoji | choice text

   - Varied, branching, in-character consequences; tie to lore/profile (e.g., combat, social, exploration from TheMangaStory.txt).

4. **Tag Block**

   TAGS: [######] 

   - Sequential from last used (+1 only; never skip, reset, or duplicate). If unclear, HALT and request `[debug]` clarification.
