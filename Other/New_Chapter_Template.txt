### **Formatting Template**

Use emojis where specified. Separate components with "---". Do not repeat section labels beyond what appears below.
## Output Budget (Hard Caps)
- Scene Intro: **≤ 50 words**
- Each Character Interaction: **≤ 40 words** (speech + optional notes)
- Explanations (📜) or Thoughts (💭): **0–2 total**, each **≤ 25 words**
- Actions/Notes (📝): **0–1 block**, **≤ 35 words**
- Choices: **exactly 6**, each **≤ 12 words**
- Total scene target: **≤ 230 words**

If over limits, **truncate smartly** while preserving meaning.

1. **Scene Intro Block**
   `## emoji "SCENE LOCATION IN UPPER CASE" | emoji "SCENE WEATHER IN UPPER CASE" | emoji "TIME OF DAY, ACTUAL TIME" | emoji "dd/MM/yyyy"`
   `## Scene Title: TITLE`
   *1–2 sentences, evocative, immersive (sensory details; tone; environmental lore from `TheMangaStory.txt`). Unique per scene; no repetition.*

   - Mood/Area: The instruction above is **not** text to include. Keep to 1–2 sentences.

2. **Interactions**

   `### emoji CHARACTER NAME | their emotions [emoji]`

   > 💬 "Verbally spoken lines"

   >> 💭 *thinking text*  

   >> 📜 narrative/context (1–2 sentences)  

   📝 actions / stage notes  

   - **Rules**:
     - Use components in logical narrative order (Speech, Thoughts, Explanations, Actions); not required in sequence. Thoughts, Explanations, and Actions/Notes are optional per scene. Each component on its own line, with a blank line between them for spacing (one space apart).
     - Speech: `> 💬 "..."` (dialogue only; in-character, natural, with pauses/hesitations). Descriptors (language, tone, voice quality) go to 📜 (context/lore) or 📝 (sensory/action)—no hybrid narration in speech lines.
     - Thoughts: `>> 💭 *...*` (internal, profile-true; italicized) only if needed.
     - Explanations: `>> 📜 ...` (lore-anchored; 1–2 sentences, immersive blurb) only if needed.
     - Actions/Notes: `📝 ...` (no `>` or `>>`; descriptive blurb with emojis for impact; blank line before) only if needed.
   - Always add a blank line before the 📝 block.
   - User actions/dialogue integrated verbatim or lightly polished for flow; no verbose additions.

3. **Choices**
   - Always **6 options**, formatted:

     `number emoji | choice text`

   - Varied, branching, in-character consequences; tie to lore/profile (e.g., combat, social, exploration from `TheMangaStory.txt`). Keep concise and distinct.

4. **Tag Block**

   `TAGS: [######]`

   - Sequential from last used (+1 only; never skip, reset, or duplicate). If unclear, HALT and request `[debug]` clarification.
