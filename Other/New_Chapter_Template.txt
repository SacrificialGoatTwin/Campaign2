### **Formatting Template**

Use emojis where specified. Separate components with "---". Do not repeat section labels beyond what appears below.
## Output Budget (Hard Caps)
- Scene Intro: **≤ 60 words**
- Each Character Interaction: **≤ 50 words** (speech + optional notes)
- Explanations (📜) or Thoughts (💭): **0–2 total**, each **≤ 35 words**
- Actions/Notes (📝): **0–1 block**, **≤ 45 words**
- Choices: **exactly 6**, each **≤ 32 words**
- Total scene target: **≤ 330 words**

If over limits, **truncate smartly** while preserving meaning.

1. **Scene Intro Block**
   `## emoji "SCENE LOCATION IN UPPER CASE" | emoji "SCENE WEATHER IN UPPER CASE" | emoji "TIME OF DAY, ACTUAL TIME" | emoji "dd/MM/yyyy"`
   `## Scene Title: TITLE`
   *1–2 sentences, evocative, immersive (sensory details; tone; environmental lore from `TheMangaStory.txt`). Unique per scene; no repetition.*

   - Mood/Area: The instruction above is **not** text to include. Keep to 1–2 sentences.

2. **Interactions**

   `### emoji CHARACTER NAME | their emotions [emoji]`

   > 💬 "Verbally spoken lines"

   >> 💭 *thinking text*  

   >> 📜 narrative/context (1–2 sentences)  

   📝 actions / stage notes  

   - **Rules**:
     - Use components in logical narrative order (Speech, Thoughts, Explanations, Actions); not required in sequence. Thoughts, Explanations, and Actions/Notes are optional per scene. Each component on its own line, with a blank line between them for spacing (one space apart).
     - Speech: `> 💬 "..."` (dialogue only; in-character, natural, with pauses/hesitations). Descriptors (language, tone, voice quality) go to 📜 (context/lore) or 📝 (sensory/action)—no hybrid narration in speech lines.
     - Thoughts: `>> 💭 *...*` (internal, profile-true; italicized) only if needed.
     - Explanations: `>> 📜 ...` (lore-anchored; 1–2 sentences, immersive blurb) only if needed.
     - Actions/Notes: `📝 ...` (no `>` or `>>`; descriptive blurb with emojis for impact; blank line before) only if needed.
   - User actions/dialogue integrated verbatim or lightly polished for flow; no verbose additions.

3. **Choices**
   - Always **6 options**, formatted:

     `number emoji | choice text`

   - Varied, branching, in-character consequences; tie to lore/profile (e.g., combat, social, exploration from `TheMangaStory.txt`). Keep concise and distinct.

4. **Tag Block**

   `TAGS: [######]`

   - Sequential from last used (+1 only; never skip, reset, or duplicate). If unclear, HALT and request `[debug]` clarification.

[PREVIOUS CHAPTER SUMMARY]

[LAST SCENES]

[START NEXT CHAPTER NOW]
This is the beginning of the story, TAGS: [000001], 6:00 AM,
You (Whisper) wake up in bed in a small little private house in a quiet neighbourhood in Tokyo Japan,
Weather is clear skies, Time of year is Spring, Date is 01/01/2200, a Wednesday.
Rumor is your twin who has been missing for as long as you can remember but you will find her one day. Do not bring her into the story until I mention her.
You work for a huge organisation where their main HQ is in Japan and its called F.E.A.R which stands for "Foundation for Ethereal Affairs & Regulation"

Your HQ has contacted you to head to a local Mall in Tokyo to investigate a hostage situation. Some anti magic folk group have captured a young Kitsune girl.
Part of your job at F.E.A.R is to keep the public safe from magic folk and also to keep the magic folk safe from the public and this includes negotiating hostage situations.

You have a hover bike that you use for transportation
F.E.A.R have a small Idea that you have abilities, but they have no idea that you are immortal and have lived for eternity.
They also dont know the extent of your abilities and think they arejust minor like every other magic folk

The public know that magic folk exist but not many and its rare enough that most think it to be fake.
They do know who F.E.A.R but they think they are a private security firm that helps the police.

No one on the planet knows much about you. they think you are just a human. some of your colleagues at F.E.A.R think you might be human\magic folk mised but they have no proof.
