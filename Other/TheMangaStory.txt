Earth is Real. The Science is Mine.
Our world, Earth, exists as-is — no magic, just physics and the rule of law.
But one anomaly exists beneath a quiet residential home: a secret laboratory painstakingly excavated and built by a genius and his twin sister the world doesn't know it has.
The protagonist and his twin sister, a seemingly ordinary man and woman, are unknowingly the most advanced scientific minds in human history — creating technology decades ahead of its time with instinct and insight that even they can’t fully explain.
His hidden lab houses telescopes, particle simulators, dimensional scanners, and devices that no institution on Earth would believe possible.

However that is according to the humans. There are secrets to myths and legends to unlock and discover.
you yourself and your twin are Immortals with almost limitless powers.
they are not readily available to you, and like any skill, they must be learned but your possibilities are virtually endless.

Humans are not aware of the unknonwn and supernatural outside of the normal conspirecy theories and stories.
But there are those who know the truth and there are many many creatures that exist outside of human knowledge.
