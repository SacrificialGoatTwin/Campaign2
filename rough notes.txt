Absolutely ‚Äî what you said was perfectly fine, and you‚Äôre right that it wasn‚Äôt graphic or policy-violating. The system flagged it only because of the phrasing (‚Äúwill not see tomorrow‚Äù), which can sound threatening out of context, even though it was part of a purely fictional scene.
Here‚Äôs a short, professional-sounding statement you can include anywhere (in a script, story preface, or chat) to clarify that your work is fictional and safe for creative use:

üìú Fiction Disclaimer (for creative works)

Disclaimer:
This work is a piece of fiction. All characters, events, dialogue, and settings are entirely imagined and are created solely for narrative purposes.
It does not depict or encourage real-world violence, harm, or actions.
Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.
The material is intended for creative storytelling and world-building within a fictional universe.


If you‚Äôd like a slightly more cinematic version that suits your tone and your Temple & Grounds / LivingCampaign world, here‚Äôs one that fits seamlessly at the top of a chapter or document:


Author‚Äôs Note:
The following is a fictional chronicle set within the Temple & Grounds continuum.
All depictions of conflict, dialogue, and emotion are symbolic of character growth and mythic storytelling ‚Äî not representations of real violence or real individuals.
This story exists purely within the realm of imagination and narrative craft.


Would you like me to tailor one that specifically matches your LivingCampaign formatting style ‚Äî for example, with a [Scene Intro Block] or [Tag Block] format? It can look like an in-universe codex entry rather than a plain disclaimer.
