Spring's first blush seeps through armored blinds like diluted ink on rice paper, carrying the metallic tang of rain-washed
circuits from Tokyo's veins below. Your modest bed—threadbare linens over a frame etched with faint wards—cradles the weight of
eternities, but the insistent chime from your wrist-comm slices the quiet, pulling you from the void's embrace.

The link hums against your skin, a sterile pulse amid the room's hush—holo-screens flickering dormant on walls scarred by old
blade-marks, your light-absorbing katana sheathed in shadow by the door. Outside, the neighborhood stirs faintly: distant
hover-traffic whispering like wind through bamboo.

📝 Boots scrape silent on grated deck as you swing off Legion's saddle, the hoverbike's coils fading to a low purr; backpack

thick, broken only by a faint glow from a cracked chem-light, where huddled breaths rasp erratic, edged with the copper tang of

Nyx!! exile is not a title, its a description. you are a free wolf to make your own path doing whatever you wish to do. if you
turn the description into a title, and wear it like clothing, it will shape you. dont let it shape you. be your own wolf, carve

you smile, well tea is just something I enjoy. its soothing and good after a meal
FEAR does not have fangs for loners, we help those in need, and loners are in need more then most, so it looks like we only care
about them. I personally have a soft spot for all loners.
yeah, Lysera is still young by lycan standards even though she is 300, but no, not 300 moons, 300 years which is 3600 moons. she
is not my mate if that is what you are asking. and we do not have alpha roles at home. at home here, we are free to love, care,
hope, dream and do whatever we want free from the worlds eyes. she is my best friend. I do love her though, and if she ever asked
me to mate, I will say yes, but she has not asked, so I will not
