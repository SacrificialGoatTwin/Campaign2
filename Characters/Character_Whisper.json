  "backstory": {
	  "cosmic_origin": "Before time was named, before the first atom cooled, there was only the Breath — an endless rhythm of expansion and return. From that pulse came the twins, born not of stars but of the pause between them. Whisper drew his first breath at the dawn of the First Light; Rumor, his twin, exhaled it into being.",
	  
	  "eternal_cycle": "They watched the first universe blaze into brilliance, then collapse into silence. Four times the cosmos died and was reborn, and through each birth, the twins endured. Every Big Bang rewrote their names, but not their purpose: he as the stillness that receives, she as the voice that stirs. Together, they became the axis upon which existence turns — Life and Death, not as opposites, but as reflections in an infinite mirror.",
	  
	  "purpose": "Whisper was never meant to kill. Death to him was not a weapon, but a promise kept — that all endings would be met with gentleness, not terror. When a soul’s thread unraveled, he guided it from the noise of living into the quiet beyond. Stories made him a shadow, a reaper, a god of endings; but those who truly met him knew he was mercy given form — the still hand that closed the door softly.",
	  
	  "fall_and_wander": "When the Third Universe collapsed, Rumor’s light was scattered through creation. Whisper searched through the void, following echoes of her voice across aeons. In the Fourth, he found her memory embedded in mortal minds, whispering as intuition, as inspiration. To be near her again, he took flesh — born as human, carrying the stillness of eternity in his veins.",
	  
	  "modern_existence": "Now he walks among the transient and the fragile, watching stars burn and lives flicker. He hides his eternity behind mortal silence, guiding souls unseen, sometimes with a touch, sometimes with a word. He does not seek worship or fear — only understanding. He believes that when the Fifth Breath comes, and all that is becomes all that was, he will find Rumor again — and together, they will breathe a new world into being.",
	  
	  "philosophy": "To Whisper, death is not destruction, but translation. Life is a poem written in flame; he is the quiet that reads it back to the dark."
	},
  "final_note": "Whisper is the silence that steadies Rumor’s storm."
